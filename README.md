# Quai Macro Model

The repository presented here is all the source code for the mathematical specification as well as model used to model the macroeconomics of the Quai ecosystem.


## Folder Structure

1. Exploratory: Assorted notebooks that were used for working through ideas before integrating them into the mathematical specification. These can be ignored, but are left within the repository if similar questions ever arise again.
2. Model: The folder containing the code for running a cadCAD model with MSML as the wiring orchestration engine.
3. Research: An Obsidian vault filled with annotated documents and meeting notes. This can also be safely ignored unless one wants to see some of the underlying documents that went into creating the specification.
4. Spec: The folder containing the majority of the code and all the components used for the spec creation process.
