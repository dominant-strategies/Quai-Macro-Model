- For mining boundary action there is FEV, external value
	- And then decide mine Qi, mine Quai or not at all
- If Quai is going up rapidly, many people will want to buy/mine Quai
- Miners need to pick Qi or Quai during mining, not after winning block
- Deadline push is fine
- Question of how does $D_i$ get represented
	- Framework can allow for extending the examples
	- Features as parameters of a model
	- We will have a controller calibrating step here
- Other point of non-linearity
	- Difficulty can go over many levels of magnitude
	- Does our model capture this?
	- Changes will become more or less dramatic depending on input
	- Marketable effects relative to miners
	- As market gets bigger, less impact of variance
	- We are trying to deal with these scale effects in our model
- We would love to see it over 6 levels of scale of difficulty
	- In principal controller should work over any control range
	- Which kinds of transforms we use will be how we are trying to deal with a lot of this
- We can get death spiraling with PoW and so we may need safeguarding
	- Controller trying to adjust to that fact helps drive that value (maybe more aggressively than it should)
	- Minimum ratio of which Quai/Qi can be set
	- "Floors in the controller"
		- Set initial value, 1/5 of that value as floor, below that don't reprice, and let decoupling happen
- 


Follow ups:
- Our boundary action option right now picks from a parameter that is hashpower series
	- Does this possibly need to get modified to take things in like price to modify?
	- Do we want a second options
- Minimum ratio of which Quai/Qi can be set
