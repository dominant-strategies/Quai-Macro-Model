- We can have private valuations and market prices be related but not necessarily perfectly correlated
	- Or something like there is variations in valuation but market price is the average
- BIBO stability
	- Does it require a set point
	- Dynamic [[Controller Equilibrium|equilibrium]], system is changing and moving 
		- Should resolve into an error ball in epsilon
		- Loss function should be low, but if it gets perturbed we know it will come down from the [[controller]]
- Functional dependencies on set point, what is the zero of the epsilon ball
	- Make a statement that says this is the assumption we are using
	- This set point will be dependent on state
- MRAC will be too much computational machinery
- Define a loss function
	- Lyapunov loss function probably is too difficult right now to implement
	- Doobs theorem, super-martingale
- The conversion rate basically makes an "on-demand" desk that allows you to [[Trade Tokens Wiring|arbitrage]]
- Stochastic gradient descent
	- Leads to doobs theorem
- Originally the model was trying to stabilize to 50%/50% Quai vs. Qi mining
- Attenuate volatility to be around a desired volatility
- Exogenous signal for [[block time]]
	- And get your [[Block Difficulty|difficulty]] as an inverse from there
- Sufficient statistic of interest
	- Volatility of this sufficient statistic
	- At some point we will need to come down on one side or another of what we treat as the estimate of this unobserved thing
