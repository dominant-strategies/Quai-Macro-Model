# V1 Quai Macro Model Final Presentation

## Recent Additions

- Documentation, README, general cleanup of the repository
- Previous asks on capping the conversion rate (note it does not cap the changes in KQi/KQuai but instead caps it when requesting a conversion)
- Updated all starting parameters and initial starting state with the working version of initial values
- Variable difficulty notebook for testing across a ramp up in the aggregate hashpower
- cadCAD implementation for when/if large scale simulations are wanted
