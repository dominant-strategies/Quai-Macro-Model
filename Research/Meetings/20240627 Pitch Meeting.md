- First meeting to pitch BSCI x [[Quai Network]] project
- The [[controller]] should be robust over 6-9 orders of magnitude for things like supply
- What are we [[Stability Metrics|stabilizing]] and over what horizons?
- If there is a potential for the [[controller]] to be changing in the future, it should be projected out to ensure that users understand this may happen in the future (instead of it happening ad hoc)
- Need to have [[Stability Metrics|stability targets]]
- There are two tokens in play:
	- **[[Qi Type|Qi]]**
		- [[Endogenous Stablecoin]]
		- Should be proportional to [[Hashrate Type|hashrate]]
		- Through the [[Hashrate Type|hashrate]] relation is how the [[Qi Type|Qi]] is meant to be correlated to energy prices
	- **[[Quai Type|Quai]]**
		- Traditional Deflationary Token
		- The log of the [[Hashrate Type|hashrate]] is used for [[Quai Minting Wiring|minting]]
- The [[Controller Exchange Wiring]] can exchange between the two tokens
- There should be a [[Schelling Point]] that is approached through [[Trade Tokens Wiring|arbitrage]]
- If the aggregate flows are balanced than the [[controller]] is working
- Function representing energy
	- Choice of [[Mining Wiring|mining]] or [[Trade Tokens Wiring|arbitrage]]
