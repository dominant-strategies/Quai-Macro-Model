# 9/9/2024 Update

## Development Progress

- All core development issues are now complete
- The "Controller Basic Scenarios.ipynb" file holds the current baseline scenarios
    - These will be expanded to have a. larger scenarios with parameter sweeping b. more metrics and visualizations
- Beta estimation proved to be tricky and we will discuss some of the findings and caveats in its own section
- Looking forward, the following is the work to be done:
    - General cleanup, integration of some of the final HackMD content into MSML components
    - Expansion of the testing scenarios
    - Finalization of the starting parameters and state
    - Expanding population beta movements to be pulled off a distribution instead of deterministic with a policy option
    - Re-implementation of legacy controllers for A/B Testing
    - Moving logic into cadCAD model for final scenario runs
    - Final model analysis and write-up

## Beta Estimation

- Beta estimation (for predicting of user Qi/Quai preferences) proved to be difficult but has been since resolved
- Original model aimed to use stochastic gradient descent and logistic regression to converge to the population beta but it failed to accurately predict them
- The current working model (which is policy option #2) is a rolling logistic regression which holds on to the latest 1000 blocks for prediction
    - In the case that all were Qi/Quai it simply stays with the last round's estimated betas
- The notebook "Exploratory/Logistic V2.ipynb" holds examples for testing the model
- Statistically speaking, there is an issue when entering into a very low or very high difficulty regime if the scale of beta is not larger enough. This weakness, however, would be a problem for all models given if all blocks were taken as one token there is no need for prediction

## Simulation Plan / Walkthrough

- All parameters can be swept over in different combinations
- The parameters starting with FP, for functional parameterization, control shifting a block's implementation from one option to the next. I.e. switching "FP Beta Estimation Policy" from "Rolling Logistic Regression Estimation" to "SGD Logistic Classifier Training" would make the simulation run its beta estimation with the SGD model instaed of the rolling logistic model
- Multiple monte carlo runs can be run per parameter selection to improve accuracy
- There are post-processing functions, metrics, and visualizations for easy viewing of the simulation results

## Discussion / Working Time

- Time reserved for either discussion or going through the starting state/parameters to define out together
