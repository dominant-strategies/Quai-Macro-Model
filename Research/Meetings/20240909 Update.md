# 9/9/2024 Update

## Development Progress

- All core development issues are now complete
- The "Controller Basic Scenarios.ipynb" file holds the current baseline scenarios
    - These will be expanded to have a. larger scenarios with parameter sweeping b. more metrics and visualizations
- Beta estimation proved to be tricky and we will discuss some of the findings and caveats in its own section
- Looking forward, the following is the work to be done:
    - General cleanup, integration of some of the final HackMD content into MSML components
    - Expansion of the testing scenarios
    - Finalization of the starting parameters and state
    - Expanding population beta movements to be pulled off a distribution instead of deterministic with a policy option
    - Re-implementation of legacy controllers for A/B Testing
    - Moving logic into cadCAD model for final scenario runs
    - Final model analysis and write-up
