# 8/16/2024 Dev Update

## Summary

- Progress has been made on finalizing the simulation apparatus, albeit we still need to finish the controller submodule before we can have the full simulation architecture. 
- There are 62 issues open in the github repo and 95 issues closed, but most of the 62 have been talked through and have a gameplan so the progress is actually further than 95 / (62 + 95), and not all issues are created the same anyways
- There are a lot of work in progress pieces but these will all come together in the very near future

## Simulation Architecture V2

- The high level simulation architecture is mostly finalized with a few open questions, left to be addressed in the oustanding questions section
- I will now to pan over to the Obsidian canvas to go through the current planned blocks for the simulation


## High Level Status Update - Implementations and Spec

1. Metrics (MSML component meaning the modularized functions taking state, parameters, and some input and mapping out values to be used across components): Most of the metrics are complete in both the specification as well as implemented in code bound to the specification
2. Prices Wiring:
3.
