The supply of [[Qi Type|Qi]] is determined by the following formula:

$$\text { Supply }{ }_{Q i}=\sum\left(\text { Emissions }_{Q i}\right) \pm \sum\left(\text { Conversions }_{Q i}\right)$$

The [[Block Reward Policy|block reward function]] only defines how many [[Qi Type|Qi]] tokens can _potentially_ be emitted. Actual, realized supply [[emissions]] from block rewards are determined by the [[Mining Payment Policy|choices miners must make to receive only either Quai or Qi, a selection they may change going forward at any time]].

In addition to the effects from this new flow of Quai and/or Qi issuance, the respective supply stock of [[Qi Type|Qi]] is affected by the [[Conversions Wiring|conversion feature between existing Qi and Quai]] at the current [[Block Mining Rewards Ratio Metric|block mining rewards ratio]] (e.g. between the # of [[Quai Type|Quai]] tokens/block and # of [[Qi Type|Qi]] tokens/block), which is accessible to anyone -- not just miners.

As such, the supply of Qi at any given time is the cumulative result of [miner-selected emissions](https://qu.ai/docs/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/block-rewards/) and [token conversions](https://qu.ai/docs/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/conversions/).
