1. Is [[Quai Type|Quai]] supposed to always be deflationary or just in aggregate? During first meeting it was said that it was supposed to be a classic deflationary token.
2. Are there any other interventions besides [[Controller Exchange Rate Wiring]] for the [[Controller]]?
3. What are we [[Stability Metrics|stabilizing]] and over what horizons?
4. What are the priorities between:
	- Having the exchange between [[Quai Type|Quai]] and [[Qi Type|Qi]] be stable / close to the theoretical "no arbitrage price"
	- Have stability in price movements, i.e. low standard deviation in either price returns or log price returns
	- Have stability against energy as a benchmark (likely difficult because it requires an assumption on appropriate benchmarking of electricity prices)
5. What is the appropriate time scale for the simulation?
	- The timescale of the simulation likely will depend on the actuation frequency of the [[controller]]
6. Is the controller going to be called when certain thresholds are breached or will the controller be called at some given frequency of time?
7. "Quai is a digitally scarce asset designed to function as a programmable store-of-value within Quai Network. Quai has an effectively fixed supply in the sense that inflation trends toward zero and there will be a terminal supply amount -- however,Â [this terminal supply amount will be determined by market dynamics, and is not predefined](https://qu.ai/docs/learn/tokenomics/token-dynamics/supply-growth/)." -> Is there any situation in which inflation can pick up again leading to this not being true?
