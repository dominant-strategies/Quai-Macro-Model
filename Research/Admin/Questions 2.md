## Vesting

- Some context for the question is [here](https://github.com/BlockScience/Quai-Macro-Model/issues/6)
- Current questions around it are:
    - Confirming that the unlock schedule is going to be that there is 100% unlock right at the unlock time (as opposed to linear vesting)
    - Is it ok to not model initial allocations vesting over time (the tokens to founders and investors)? And if it does need to be modeled, is it going to be based on linear vesting?
