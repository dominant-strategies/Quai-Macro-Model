[[Block Reward Space|Quai rewards]] are [[Block Reward Policy|issued]] in proportion to the [[Block Difficulty|“bits” of difficulty]] that a valid [[block hash]] achieved, approximately represented by the number of leading zeros in the target value.

$$\text { BlockReward }{ }_{Q u a i} \propto \log _2(\text { Difficulty })$$
