[[Quai Supply Metric|Quai]] and [[Qi Supply Metric|Qi supply]] will be determined in relation to the [[Network Growth Rate Metric|growth of the network]] as well as the [[miner]] reward selection and conversions between them. As such, the below are **merely hypothetical examples** to demonstrate the **potential** effect of certain token mechanics, and are **not expectations or projections**.

These illustrative examples assume:

- [[Miner|Miners]] take 100% of block reward in [[Quai Type|Quai]] rather than any in [[Qi Type|Qi]], and that there is no net effect of conversions between the two.
- Varying network [[Difficulty Growth Rate Metric|difficulty growth rates]] based on Bitcoin’s growth:
    - **Example 1**: Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, extrapolating that same growth rate over an additional 7 years.
    - **Example 2**: also Bitcoin’s growth from 2011 through 2023, but spreads it out over 20 years.
    - **Example 3**: Bitcoin’s growth between 2011 through 2016, spread out over 20 years.

These examples also take into account the [[Genesis Quai Parameter|3 billion initial Quai tokens minted and allocated in the genesis block]]
