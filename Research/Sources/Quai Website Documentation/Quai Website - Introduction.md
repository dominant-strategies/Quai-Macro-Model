# [[Quai Network]]

**[[Quai Network]] is crypto for the global and compute economies.**

**[[Quai Network|Quai]] is the only fully scalable and programmable [[Proof-of-Work]] [[Layer-1]].** Through the implementation of a variety of **new [[Proof-of-Work]] primitives**, including a category-creating native “[[stablecoin]]” connected to the cost of energy, Quai brings reliable, real-world value on-chain to function as financial infrastructure for a compute-centric economy.

- **Energy-Based “[[Stablecoin]]”** to function as decentralized money for the compute economy
- **Infinite Scalability** to accommodate an infinitely growing userbase of humans and AI agents

## Energy-Based “[[Stablecoin]]”

Within Quai, [[Proof-of-Work]] is used not only to [[Network Security Metrics|secure the network from attackers]], but also to function as an oracle for real-world demand and energy costs, allowing for the creation of a **completely decentralized “stablecoin” tied to energy**. This token is not pegged to or backed by any asset, but rather exclusively uses [[Trade Tokens Wiring|market incentives]] to consistently drive the token’s price towards the cost of energy.

Energy is the single largest input to both human activity and artificial intelligence. **The intrinsic value of energy to both man and machine makes it an ideal foundation for a new currency to be built upon.**

[[Quai Network]] joins protocols like [Hacash](https://hacash.money/) and [Themelio](https://docs.themelio.org/whitepapers/melmint-v2/) as a leader in the emerging category of decentralized [[Proof-of-Work]] “stablecoins.”

## Infinite Scalability[​](https://qu.ai/docs/learn/intro/#infinite-scalability "Direct link to Infinite Scalability")

Through the use of a new [[Proof-of-Work Fork-choice]] rule named [[Proof-of-Entropy-Minima|Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)]], [[Quai Network]] is able to remain in [[Consensus]] while coordinating an infinitely growing number of [[Execution Shard|execution shards]]. This property allows [[Quai Network]] to **add [[Execution Shard|shards]] to the network as needed** in order to meet perpetually growing demand. The only tradeoff to adding [[Execution Shard|shards]] to Quai (and thus increasing [[Throughput Metric|throughput]]) is an increased time to [[cross-shard settlement]].

[[Trustless Bridge|Trustless bridging]] between all [[Execution Shard|shards]] in the network is achieved by [[Coincident Block|using miners to create objective links between shards]].

[[Quai Network]]’s native, pre-defined scaling creates a mechanism for congestion to be alleviated as demand increases, **keeping fees permanently low** even with growing usage.

# Testnets

Currently, Quai Network is in the **testnet and development phase**. The roadmap for Quai Network includes two remaining testnets prior to Mainnet launch:

1. Golden Age Testnet
2. Silicon Age Testnet

For each of these Testnets, our team at [Dominant Strategies](https://dominantstrategies.io/) expects to run both a Testnet and Devnet, in addition to providing tools such as [block explorers](https://qu.ai/docs/participate/use-quai/block-explorers/), [network statistics pages](https://stats.quai.network/), and [faucets](https://qu.ai/docs/participate/use-quai/testnet-faucet/).
