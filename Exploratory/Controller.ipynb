The interpretation of this is that _deviations from indifference reveals that one token is more valuable than the other_. In the case that one token (_qi_) is to reflect the value of hashpower (difficulty), indifference is a _reference_ or _focal_ point from which the value of hashpower may be observed from miner decisions.\n",
